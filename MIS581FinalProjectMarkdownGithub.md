**Business Analysis for the Strategic Transition to Electric Vehicles in the US**

**Introduction**

In recent years, in the automotive industry, the paradigm shift to electric vehicles (EVs) across the globe are gaining popularity because more people, companies, and countries are concerned about the long-term sustainability of climate change. There has been a shift in consumers and corporations to have efficient alternatives to internal combustible engine vehicles (ICEVs). Also, with technological advancements and an emphasis on reducing vehicle emissions, EVs can be used as personal and commercial alternatives to ICEVs. This research proposal presents the benefits of transitioning to EVs over ICEVs for car buyers and its effects on the gasoline industry. The project reviews the plan for its implementation with background information, the benefits of electric vehicles for community stakeholders and business shareholders, and the implementation and challenges with EVs.

**Objectives**

First, the lower total cost of ownership with EVs includes lower maintenance costs than ICEVs, which means significant savings for small businesses with a fleet of vehicles, such as catering or landscaping services. Secondly, in research from Almansour, EVs produce zero emissions, which can significantly reduce a business's carbon footprint (2022). Therefore, using digital marketing to overcome challenges and adoption rates of EVs helps the environment and can improve a business's reputation to attract eco-conscious customers (Almansour, 2022). Technological advancements have improved productivity and increased efficiency of extended mileage per charge range and quicker charging times between vehicles charges.

**Literature Review**

The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that the number of EVs on the road in the US grew from 170,000 in 2013 to about 1.8 million in 2020 (*Global Electric Vehicle Stock by Region, 2010-2020 – Charts – Data & Statistics - IEA, n.d.).* Any apprehensive consumer or small business can see exponential growth within the EV market from a niche to a broad market necessity to reinvest into with their resources. The automotive industry categorizes and differentiates the EV market as battery electric vehicles (BEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and plug-in/hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). Subsequently, BEVs draw their power source directly from electric power sources such as charging stations. Whereas PHEVs combine an electrical battery with an internal combustion engine, HEVs contain a battery and a combustible motor that derive energy from the battery when braking. Accessibility and multiple options were some factors that contributed to the significant growth of electric vehicles in the US.

Moreover, consumer demand and interest in EVs were for renewable alternatives to ICEVs, technological advancements in battery technologies for longer-range EVs, and local, state, and federal incentives for EV adoption in the US. Palmer et al. (2018) research notes that poor air quality for nearly 7 million people annually and improving urban air pollution concerns decarbonization with low to zero emissions vehicles. Technological advancements, consumer demand for environmental sustainability, and government initiatives to transition to cleaner, renewable energy sources have grown the US electric vehicle (EV) market. A discussion with an analysis of the US EV market can provide consumers and small business owners insight into why investing is essential for long-term sustainability and potential growth.

Electric vehicles have become increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and technological advancements. However, the cost is one of the main concerns for consumers and businesses considering the switch to EVs. This proposal aims to compare the costs of EVs and ICEVs to provide a clearer picture of the financial implications of transitioning to EVs. Research has shown that EVs have a lower total cost of ownership than ICEVs due to lower fuel and maintenance costs; comparatively average EV cost is \$3.45 per 100 miles versus ICEVs' \$13.52 per 100 miles (see Figure 1). Therefore, zero emissions from EVs make them more appealing to eco-centric consumers and environmentally friendly options for businesses. The global EV market consists of battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles; the market value is expected to grow from \$411.4 billion to \$1.3 trillion over the next five years (*Electric Vehicle Market Analysis - Industry Report - Trends, Size & Share*, n.d.) However, upfront costs for electric vehicles from lightweight sedans such as EV 2018 Nissan Leaf \$29995 versus the ICEV sport utility vehicle Toyota RAV4 \$24910, after the electric vehicle tax credit (*2019 Cost of Electric Cars for Top Brands \| EnergySage, 2019*). The \$4000 difference may justify for consumers and business owners the reduced maintenance expenses with EVs compared to ICEVs. Also, Tucker’s blog highlights how the maintenance costs with EVs are lower than ICEVs because there are no transmission fluids or oil changes associated with EVs. However, the labor costs for specialized technician repair of EVs are 1.6 times higher than ICEVs. Overall, the total cost of ownership with EVs compared to ICEVs can save nearly \$2300 in maintenance and fuel costs- including US oil use by nearly 2 million barrels a day by 2035 (*Top Five Reasons to Choose an Electric Car*, n.d.).

Therefore, environment-friendly, long-term sustainability is one of the benefits for both businesses and consumers. However, lower vehicle performance, higher costs than ICEVs, and an emerging charging infrastructure are hurdles to growing EV adoption rates. First, the EV charging infrastructure is critical to growth in the US. Loveday's (2023) research highlights that the US Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center states that the US has 50,000 public EV charging stations and over 130,000 individual (EVSE) charging ports. The energy expenses with fuel costs for ICEVs are \$13.25 versus \$3.45 for EVs (Infographic: Electric Vehicles - Oil Savings in Action, 2013).

Consequently, many current and potential consumers need access to convenient charging stations, unlike gas stations with ICEVs. Also, nearly 90% of EV charging stations are Level 1, charging 200 miles in two to three hours, and Level 2, fully fast charging 200 miles in 15 minutes, like filling up ICEVs at gas stations (S et al., 2022). Therefore, additional investment and a more significant expansion of Level 2 fast charging stations are necessary to keep up with the EV growth rates to ease consumer skepticism.

Government incentives and policies significantly increased EV sales in the US from 2013 to 2020. For example, California leads all fifty states in EV sales because of the state regulations like the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project rebate and Zero-Emission Vehicle mandate in conjunction with an Inflation Reduction Action of up to \$7500 in federal tax credits for EV buyers. Ewing’s research (2023) notes that the government incentives and price cuts from Ford and Tesla automakers have reduced their EV prices to match their gas counterparts for greater EV adoption. Most importantly, global automakers Volvo, General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover have pledged to transition all vehicles to 100% electric by 2035 (Rosenberg, 2021). Smaller markets with lower EV adoption rates can aggressively market these credits to potential buyers. Technological advancement with existing renewable resources such as wind and solar power can aid the growth and adoption of EVs for consumers and small businesses. The implementation and integration of microgrid technology using renewable energy to create another source of EV energy outlets. Therefore, Jiang et al. 's research (2017) notes that the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology model with two-way energy distribution between microgrids can increase renewable energy and reduce abandoned solar/wind energy. Expanding on this technology can allow potential businesses and consumers to access other outlets within an EV charging network, primarily in rural/isolated regions where traditional EV charging is incapable. Moreover, EVs' most significant competitor and the most prevalent challenge is to build an infrastructure to emulate the deployment of ICEV with more EV share in those markets.

Additional external factors with EV sales include US gasoline retail prices, which have three different octane gasoline grades: regular, midgrade, and premium. The US Energy Information Administration's (EIA) website reports how US retail gas prices combine crude oil costs, distribution fees, and state taxes (Wagner, 2022). Also, over half of the US gasoline prices until 2020 were primarily associated with crude oil costs—nearly one-quarter of US gasoline accounts for reformulated fuel, therefore higher fuel prices due to refining processes (Brasch, 2022). Additionally, supply and demand affect US gas prices, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Moreover, all formulations' average US gas price was \$2.17 in 2020, then prices reached \$4.06 in 2022 (Wagner, 2022).

**Methodology and Hypotheses**

First, the datasets to retrieve US EV data sales include the Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC) and autosinnovate.org's electric vehicles sales dashboard. Also, US Energy Information Administration data for gasoline prices are other variables related to electric vehicles. Consequently, data collection from AFDC lists US government tax incentives and locations of battery charging relative to the predictability of EV sales to aid consumer/business demand. Various tools are available to analyze electric vehicle (EV) sales, including data visualization tools, statistical testing tools, and spreadsheet integration with software programs. Moreover, a problem statement formed with hypotheses can determine a correlation of EV sales, tax incentives, and gas prices to predict future EV sales. For example, a problem statement for a business owner would be, “How can switching to EVs be useful for the business in the short-term or long-term? Also, consumers and businesses can ask, “Would an increase in gas prices affect their likelihood of purchasing an EV?”

Therefore, the null hypothesis, H0: No relationship between yearly EV sales and yearly Gas Prices. (H0: β = 0)

Also, the alternate hypothesis, Ha: There is a relationship between yearly EV Sales and yearly Gas Prices. (Ha: β ≠ 0)

Tableau, SAS, and R are the tools that can visualize and provide the automotive industry's data story with EVs. Additionally, Tableau can easily apply dashboards and visualizations to show EV sales across multiple regions and vehicle categories. Tableau can create different chart types to visualize EV sales data to forecast future trends with interactive dashboards to provide decision-makers insights to compare expenses with ICEVs and EVs. Integrating multiple data sources for EV sales data can help visualize different regions or sales channels to analyze trends, one of the intuitive features of Tableau (Renee, 2022). For example, see Figure 1 for real-time Tableau data updates are beneficial for decision-makers to project or modify EV sales accordingly. Moreover, Hoelscher and Mortimer (2018) note the annual Gartner report, which ranks Business Intelligence and Analytics perennially ranks Tableau highest in vision completeness and execution.

Secondly, statistical analytic tools such as SAS can perform statistical tests, create predictive models, and decipher patterns from the EV sales data. The statistical analysis within SAS includes linear regression models and clustering to identify patterns or relationships. Also, Iacobucci et al. (2022) highlight how SAS has software packages to identify and perform parallel correlation analysis for variables that can effectively determine correlations between gasoline prices or government incentives with EV sales. SAS provides end users with an array of data management tools to cleanse and transform EV sales data for analysis. Therefore, SAS visualizations are easy-to-understand for users with complex datasets that may vary in categories, such as EV sales with multiple vehicle models. The ability to import and export electric sales data with Microsoft Excel spreadsheet allows for the organization, cleansing, and finer manipulation of automotive data into other software programs like Tableau and SAS.

**Findings**

The process to import the MIS581 Gas Prices EV Sales Excel spreadsheet which contains the US Gas Prices from yearly averages from 2013 to 2022 retrieved from EIA's website (*U.S. All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices (Dollars Per Gallon)*, n.d.) into the Tableau Public desktop. Also, the MIS581 Gas Prices EV Sales spreadsheet contains EV sales filtered with BEV, PHEV, and HEV sales from the same period (*Alternative Fuels Data Center: Maps and Data*, n.d.). The website's dashboard contains EV registrations from all 50 states between January 2013 to September 2022. The primary sources listed on the site reference the IHS Markit and Hedges and Co., which collected statistical data from fueleconomy.gov's website. Over 7200 fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) were excluded because they would not statistically affect the analysis. The spreadsheet uploaded contains three columns and ten observations for analysis. The dimension value within the Tableau worksheet from imported data is the Year of Sales, and continuous variables are Gas Prices, including Total Electric Vehicle sales. Therefore, the business questions answered from the visualization within Tableau software allow leadership to see comparative US gas prices and US EV sales for decision-making to proceed with a new fleet of EVs within operating budgets for the next three to five years. See Figure 2. Also, SAS provides various tools to analyze electric vehicle sales data for automotive industry leaders to gain valuable insights with its data mining capabilities, make informed decisions for project planning, and drive business growth with EV sales data. Business leaders' questions on when to switch to EVs or if there should be long-term reinvestment with ICEVs can be determined with SAS' linear regression and distribution models. First, the analysis begins with the spreadsheet data uploaded into the SAS OnDemand for Academics program and formatted into a SAS .ctl file to analyze. SAS's Summary Statistic tool displayed a table and density curves for analyzing Gas Prices and Total Electric Vehicles Sales variables. SAS visualization of a histogram with a standard density curve shows sales and gas data distribution for the output data. Also, the output data contained central tendency measures of \$2.923 for the mean, a standard deviation of \$0.604, a minimum of \$2.250, and \$4.059 maximum values for the dependent, Gas Prices variable. Also, the measures are mean of 776,007 EVs sold, a standard deviation of 390341 EVs, a minimum of 477,844, and a maximum of 1,606,627 from the ten observations for the independent variable, Total Electric Vehicle Sales (Bevans, 2022). The density curves from both variable graphs are skewed to the right and have unimodal shape which indicated the mean is greater than the median. See Figure 3. Furthermore, correlation analysis and linear regression tools within SAS’ utilities can provide predictive and correlation analysis for Gas Prices and Total Electric Vehicles variables. SAS’ Correlation Analysis shows a strong positive of 0.7950 with Gas Prices and Total Vehicle Sales, indicating rising prices and EV sales. Subsequently, a strong correlation does not necessarily indicate that the predictive model is a good fit because the y-intercept's p-value of .0005 and the Total Electric Vehicles Sales variable with a p-value of .1819 indicates statistical insignificance. Also, an R-value of .2108 indicates that the dependent variable, Gas Prices, cannot be explained by the movements of the independent variable, Total Electric Vehicle Sales. Therefore, interpreting the results may need a larger population sample with more years of data to provide greater insight for business decision-makers. Thus, accept the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between yearly EV Sales and yearly Gas Prices for the fitness of model. See Figure 4.

**Limitations**

When switching to EVs from ICEVs, consideration for all stakeholders and shareholders is critical to successful implementation. Therefore, a cost-benefit analysis of EVs, current infrastructure to support the long-term investment in EVs, and planning and training stakeholders with the introduction of new EVs. Moreover, EV use in a business setting is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for the costs associated with transitioning to EVs, such as purchasing and charging infrastructure and compare it to the potential savings in fuel and maintenance costs. The maintenance costs for EVs over extended high mileage usage of 100, 000 miles is half as much as ICEV which can be a significant savings for a business with a fleet of vehicles (Tucker, 2021). The data to collect and analyze vehicle sales for gross domestic product from Bureau of Economic Analysis (bea.gov/tools) and United States Department of Energy Alternative Fuels data (https://afdc.energy.gov/data/). Also, a larger sample size and more years of research of Total Vehicle Sales and Gas Prices from not only the US but other countries with larger populations such as China and India may allow greater insight with goodness of fit predictive models.

Overall, assessing the infrastructure of charging stations at the business location with nearby public charging stations. Almansour notes that the decision-making process in India with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method showed that the financial and infrastructure created a positive EV adoption rate. In contrast, EV performance created a negative perception of these consumers (Almansour, 2022). Furthermore, minimal disruption to consumers and business occurs with a gradual, transitional milestone plan from ICEVs to EVs with safety training for stakeholders to build familiarity and adaptation. According to research from Ika and Munro (2022), an adaptive and agile problem-solving approach to project management with small businesses can also be applied to the grand challenge of moving from ICEVs to EVs in the automotive industry.

**Ethical Considerations**

The data collected from the US Energy Information Agency for gasoline prices and Alliance for Automotive Innovation cited their respective sources to ensure the information collected was unbiased to ensure data integrity. However, the data was cleaned and sorted into each data integration tool for statistical analysis. Therefore, the possibility and probability of data either inflated to enhance the US marketability of EVs or understated gasoline prices can be verified with due diligence of other corresponding data, such as US Gross Domestic Product with vehicle sales from 2014 to 2022. Lastly, the data collection from EVs, tax incentives, and gasoline prices reproduce and replicated from other literature reviews to ensure validity**.**
